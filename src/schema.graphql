"""
Applies authorization requirements to a field, argument, input field, or to all fields on an object/input object.
The current user must have the provided permission action, subject, and field. Subject and field are optional, but
action is required. When @Auth is applied multiple times to a single field/argument, the user must have all of the
permissions. There is currently no way to say that the user must have at least one of many permissions. This directive
has different behavior depending on where it is used.
- ARGUMENT: This is the simplest use-case. Whenever a user uses an argument, the directive makes sure that the user
has the provided permission. The subject is not applied to a specific object, but used generally.
- FIELD_DEFINITION: This is the most common use-case, but also perhaps the most complex. Whenever the user uses a field
with this directive, the user must have the provided permission both generally and specifically. If the subject matches
the name of the parent type (e.g., requesting 'id' on Role and subject is also 'Role'), then the user must have
permission to read that specific object. NOTE: There is currently not a good way to implement this with all relational
children resolved, without a hit to performance. For this reason, conditional permissions should not be based on
relational fields, as they are not guaranteed to be resolved by the time the permission is checked. If the subject does
not match the type name, then the permission is just checked generally (e.g., requesting 'person' on Role requires
permission to read the 'id' field on Person. This will just check that the user has permission to read _some_ Person's
id, but not necessarily this one. Specifically checking this person should be applied to the Person fields). When
checking the permission against the value, if the value is an array, each element of the array is checked. This could be
optimized by baking the checks into the individual resolvers and removing value checks from fields, if necessary,
however the current implementation insures against permission leaks on individual resolvers.
- INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION: When applied to input object types, we're making one major (but fair) assumption: that the
type which it's being applied to is used to mutate or create another correspond type. For example, CreateRoleInput is
used to create a Role type. This means that the user must not only have permission to create some Role, but
specifically one with the values in the CreateRoleInput, as the permission is applied to the object directly. If this
is undesirable, you can probably accomplish what you want using a combination of FIELD_DEFINITION and ARGUMENT
@Auth directives, but if not, this could be fixed with a future update to the options to @Auth.
- OBJECT: This is an alias for applying the @Auth directive to each field of the type. This is combined with (not
overwritten by) any other @Auth directives applied to the field directly.
- INPUT_OBJECT: This is an alias for applying the @Auth directive to each field of the type. This is combined with (not
overwritten by) any other @Auth directives applied to the field directly.
"""
directive @Auth(action: AbilityActions!, subject: AbilitySubjects, field: String) repeatable on FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION | ARGUMENT_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INPUT_OBJECT
"""
In the context of input types, a value being "required" is not sufficient enough to denote the difference between
nullable and non-nullable fields. This directive resolves this issue. For fields which are not required, but when they
are passed they must not be null, apply this directive. For fields which are required and must not be null, use both
this directive and the usual "!". This is technically the same as just using "!", but both are recommended for clarity.
As a result, there is currently no way in this implementation to allow for "required, but may be null", but it should
be possible in one way or another (modify AST code if you need to). Usage of @NonNull should almost always mirror the
database schema when used on CRUD inputs.
