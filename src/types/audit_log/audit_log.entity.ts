 * Audit logs are used to track changes to resources within the database. At the moment, Prisma does not have an elegant
 *  way of generating these automatically with the user's ID. It would be possible to generate automatically if we
 *  weren't logging the user who made the change using Prisma middleware or extensions. For now, they have to be
 *  logged manually using {@link PrismaService#genAuditLog}.
 *
 *  All automatic generation solutions that I came up with involved violating type safety, relying on private Prisma
 *  interfaces, and/or were so obtuse and hacky that it wasn't worth it.
