/**
 * Apollo plugin that creates a Prisma transaction for the duration of the request. This allows us to easily revert any
 *  changes made to the database if a system or permissions error occurs.
 *
 *  This is only for GraphQL requests. HTTP requests (and all other request types) are handled by the PrismaInterceptor.
 *  A plugin exists specifically for GraphQL because NestJS interceptors currently seem to only encapsulate the
 *  first/top-level resolver, and not the entire request.
 *
 *  Typically, singular queries are implicitly wrapped in a transaction, so any locks only last however long the query
 *  takes to execute. However, we are explicitly wrapping all queries within the request in a transaction, so any locks
 *  will persist for the duration of the request. This could be a pretty serious downside, but it's the simplest way to
 *  implement this kind of request-wide rollback. We will have to evaluate the implementation of this if performance
 *  becomes a problem under heavy user load, or if we ever need to perform expensive tasks within a single request.
 *
