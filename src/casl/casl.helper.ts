    /**
     * Handle a {@link Rule} definition with rule type {@link RuleType.ReadMany}. This function ensures that the user
     *  has permission to read an array of resources of the given type, and intercepts the returned values from the
     *  resolver/handler that it is applied to, to make sure the user has permission to read all the returned values.
     *
     *  In addition to traditional subject/field permission checks, ReadMany rules also allow for the use of sorting,
     *  filtering, and pagination. These permissions are handled as such:
     *
     *  - <b>Sorting:</b> The user must have {@link AbilityAction.Sort} permission on the field being sorted by. The
     *    user's ability to read the field(s) being sorted is not currently taken into account. As such, it is possible
     *    for a user to infer some information about fields which they cannot read as long as they have permission to
     *    sort by them. With combinations of subsequent sorts, the user may be able to decipher the value completely.
     *  - <b>Filtering:</b> The user must have {@link AbilityAction.Filter} permission on the field being filtered by.
     *    The user's ability to read the individual field(s) being filtered is not currently taken into account. As
     *    such, it is possible for a user to infer some information about fields which they cannot read as long as they
     *    have permission to filter by them. With complex and combinations of filters, the user may be able to decipher
     *    the value completely.
     *  - <b>Pagination:</b> Generally, there are no permission checks against permission necessary. However, if the
     *    user is using cursor-based pagination, they must have permission to sort by the "ID" field. This is because
     *    cursor-based pagination requires sorting by some field by its very nature, and the "ID" field is the only
     *    field which Glimpse currently allows to be used for this. For skip-based pagination, there are no permission
     *    checks.
     *
     *  Currently, sorting and filtering permissions cannot have conditions applied to them. It is expected that any
     *  sorting or filtering permissions that the user has, do not have conditions applied. If they do, the conditions
     *  will currently be ignored and the user will be able to sort or filter by the field regardless of the conditions.
     *
     *  The current user's permissions are determined by the {@link Express.Request#permissions} property within the
     *  current NestJS execution context. The {@link CaslInterceptor} is expected to have already initialized this
     *  value.
     *
     *  If the user does not have permission to read the resources, then this method sets {@link Express.Request#passed}
     *  to false on the context's request object and returns null, potentially before calling the handler. From there,
     *  the {@link CaslInterceptor} will see that {@link Request#passed} is false and throw an error.
     *  {@link Express.Request#passed} can also be set to false by the resolver/handler that this rule is applied to,
     *  which stops the rule checks and immediately returns back to the {@link CaslInterceptor}.
     *
     *  Options can be supplied to this function to change the behavior of the rule checks within the {@link RuleDef}
     *  argument. Namely, strict mode currently applies exclusively to this rule type, allowing you to control what
     *  happens when the user doesn't have permission to read a field only on a subset of values of the requested type.
     *
     * @see {@link RuleOptions}
     * @see {@link https://github.com/rpitv/glimpse-api/wiki/Authorization}
     *
     * @typeParam T - The type of the array of values expected to be returned by the resolver/handler which this rule
     *  is being applied to. E.g., if the resolver returns an array of {@link User| Users}, T would be {@link User}.
     *  Currently, this must be an instance of a valid {@link AbilitySubjects} type. This requirement may no longer be
     *  required.
     * @param context - NestJS execution context.
     * @param rule - Rule to test. If rule type is {@link RuleType.Custom}, an error will be thrown.
     * @param handler - The handler that calls the request method/resolver, or the next rule/interceptor in line if
     *  applicable. This is called after the necessary rule checks pass, and then additional checks are applied to the
     *  return value.
     * @returns The value returned from the handler, or null if the rule checks fail. If the rule's strict mode is
     *  enabled, then this will return null if the user doesn't have permission to read one or more of the fields on
     *  any object within the array returned by handler. However, if the rule's strict mode is disabled, then those
     *  fields will be set to null on the relevant objects. Note that if the user doesn't have permission to read the
     *  field on <i>any</i> object of the given type, the same behavior as strict mode will occur. That is, null will
     *  be returned and {@link Express.Request#passed} will be set to false. It is only when the user has permission to
     *  read the field on some objects of the given type that the strict mode behavior will differ.
     * @throws Error if the rule type is {@link RuleType.Custom}.
     * @throws Error if the current user's permissions are not initialized.
